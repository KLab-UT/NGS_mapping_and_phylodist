Non-linear negative relationship between phylogenetic distance and genomic mapping success

A major obstacle in genomic research with non-model organisms (99.99% of all organisms on earth) is the selection of an appropriate reference genome to use for bioinformatic processing of genetic sequencing data. Raw genomic data is ideally mapped to a reference genome from the same species, but limited research of non-model organisms typically means the absence of a reference genome. One solution is to use a genome from a closely-related species. However, mutations that accumulate between species scale with time, meaning that genetic dissimilarity in more distantly related taxa will result in decreased mapping efficiency. Among amniote vertebrates, squamate reptiles are a great system for testing genomic mapping efficiency across lineages since this group is the most species-rich of all amniotes. We compared mapping success of whole-genome sequence data from four whiptail lizards to 28 publicly-available vertebrate genomes. We examine the effect of phylogenetic distance on mapping success, with a special focus on the genomes within Lepidosauria (Squamate reptiles plus the Rhynchocephalians). As expected, we observe lower mapping success to more distantly-related taxa, however the relationship is non-linear. A rapid decrease in mapping success occured immediately outside of the genus the raw reads pertained to. Our results indicate that researchers working in non-model systems with no access to a closely-related (e.g., con-generic) genome will lose a significant amount of genomic data.
