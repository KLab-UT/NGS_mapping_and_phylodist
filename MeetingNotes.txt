Randy added tree to whiptail_plots (along with a new script called get_vertebrata_tree.r). The older get_tree.r has been converted to get_lepidosauria_tree.r

October 4, 2023 meeting with Dante
Dante created an awesome bar chart. Now we need to put them in order. Randy will provide the correct order.

September 27, 2023 meeting with Dante
- Map sequences to Latimeria genome
- See figure ideas about creating a bar plot with phylogeny

September 20, 2023 meeting with Dante
- Look over .r files to get a grasp as to what they do
- Figure out how we can convert our script that looks at all 27 genomes into a job array (look at Anita's email and search online for "how to create a job array in slurm"

1. To the depth_and_dist.csv file, remove the number_of_reads column and create a total_mapped_reads column. For the total_mapped_reads column and the map_percentage column, use the summary provided by samtools flagstat (https://sarahpenir.github.io/bioinformatics/awk/calculating-mapping-stats-from-a-bam-file-using-samtools-and-awk/)
2. Get distance to a couple of outgroup species. Which ones? We need to look around a find out. (Randy will do this)
3. Look into GATK documentation, and think about what you will do once you have mapped whiptail reads: https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035535932-Germline-short-variant-discovery-SNPs-Indels-

1. Verify what "number_of_reads" in the depth_and_dist.csv file means (Dante will do this)
2. Get distance to a couple of outgroup species. Which ones? We need to look around a find out. (Randy will do this)
3. Look into GATK documentation, and think about what you will do once you have mapped whiptail reads: https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035535932-Germline-short-variant-discovery-SNPs-Indels-

August 2023
1. Look into Protopterus_annectens in the depth_percentage.txt file (which is on scractch under mapped_reads)
2. Make function in get_tree.r that performs the current line "as.matrix(dist_spbset(pairwise_dist, c(pairwise_dist, c("<raw_data_taxon>", "<reference_taxon>")))[1,2]"
  --- This line is getting the phylogenetic distance from the raw_data_taxon to the reference_taxon
  --- The only thing that should be provided as an argument for the function is the reference taxon (each of the four raw data taxa should be hard coded into the function)
  --- The output should be a single phylogenetic distance value. You should assign this value to the pair of taxa.
3. The single phylogenetic distance value for each sample-reference pair should be added in the depth_and_dist.txt file as a new column

To do:

1. Delete the files of the mapped reads from the last run (that didn't run to completion)
2. On an interactive node, try running bwa mem with just one thread on one of the samples (e.g., KLC098_USD16091388L_HKFJFDSXX_L4.merged.fq.gz). If it is possible to do it with one thread, then keep the one thread for when you run it in parallel. If it doesn't work with just one thread, increase to 2 and test again. Continue this process until you identify the number of threads that will work.
3. The number of threads that work will be your value for -t in the function that calls bwa mem and samtools.
4. You need to multiply that value by 6 and use that as your value for -t in the command that runs the map_reads.sh script.
5. You then need to multiply the value from #4 above and use that as your -n value in SBATCH
6. Make sure that you have enough nodes. Assume 24 cores (each of which can run a single thread) per node. I think you can run 2 threads per core.

May 2023
1. Double check all of the mapped reads to make sure they mapped to the right genome!
  grep ^@PG KLC098_USD16091388L_HKFJFDSXX_L4.merged.sam

2. Map merged reads to reference for Aspidoscelis marmoratus (unnanotated) genome
  - Randy will work on getting genome onto lonepeak scratch
  - This has already been done for all the others

3. Map unmerged reads to reference genomes
  bwa mem -t 4 "$2" ${1}.fq.gz > "$3"/${1}.sam

4. Get number of unmerged reads from fastp for each species
  a. Count number of unmerged for read1, then count number of unmerged for read2

5. Merge "merged" .bam files for individuals that were spread accross multiple lanes
  - example code where KLC098_am_merged.bam is the new merged .bam file for the merged reads that were mapped to the am genome

9. Get percentage of merged reads that mapped to each reference
  a. Get number of total reads for each individual to each reference genome from mapped_reads/<reference_abbreviation>/<sample_id>_<reference_abbreviation>_merged.bam
    - samtools view -c <sample_id>_<reference_abbreviation>_merged.bam # do this for each *_merged.bam file

    - samtools view -c -F 260 <sample_id>_<reference_abbreviation>_merged.bam # do this for each *_merged.bam file
  c. Then divide the number of merged reads that mapped (from part b) / the total number of merged reads (from part a)

10. Get average depth for the .bam file of the merged reads for each individual

11. Get percentage of unmerged reads that mapped to each reference
  a. Get number of total reads for each individual to each reference genome from mapped_reads/<reference_abbreviation>/<sample_id>_<reference_abbreviation>_unmerged.bam

14. Get percentage of all reads (merged & unmerged) that mapped to each reference

Later: Look at mapping success between species to the A. marmoratus genome
