1. Look into Protopterus_annectens in the depth_percentage.txt file (which is on scractch under mapped_reads)
2. Make function in get_tree.r that performs the current line "as.matrix(dist_spbset(pairwise_dist, c(pairwise_dist, c("<raw_data_taxon>", "<reference_taxon>")))[1,2]"
  --- This line is getting the phylogenetic distance from the raw_data_taxon to the reference_taxon
  --- The only thing that should be provided as an argument for the function is the reference taxon (each of the four raw data taxa should be hard coded into the function)
  --- The output should be a single phylogenetic distance value. You should assign this value to the pair of taxa.
3. The single phylogenetic distance value for each sample-reference pair should be added in the depth_percentage.txt file as a new column

To do:

1. Delete the files of the mapped reads from the last run (that didn't run to completion)
2. On an interactive node, try running bwa mem with just one thread on one of the samples (e.g., KLC098_USD16091388L_HKFJFDSXX_L4.merged.fq.gz). If it is possible to do it with one thread, then keep the one thread for when you run it in parallel. If it doesn't work with just one thread, increase to 2 and test again. Continue this process until you identify the number of threads that will work.
3. The number of threads that work will be your value for -t in the function that calls bwa mem and samtools.
4. You need to multiply that value by 6 and use that as your value for -t in the command that runs the map_reads.sh script.
5. You then need to multiply the value from #4 above and use that as your -n value in SBATCH
6. Make sure that you have enough nodes. Assume 24 cores (each of which can run a single thread) per node. I think you can run 2 threads per core.

1. Double check all of the mapped reads to make sure they mapped to the right genome!
  grep ^@PG KLC098_USD16091388L_HKFJFDSXX_L4.merged.sam

2. Map merged reads to reference for Aspidoscelis marmoratus (unnanotated) genome
  - Randy will work on getting genome onto lonepeak scratch
  - This has already been done for all the others

3. Map unmerged reads to reference genomes
  bwa mem -t 4 "$2" ${1}.fq.gz > "$3"/${1}.sam

4. Get number of unmerged reads from fastp for each species
  a. Count number of unmerged for read1, then count number of unmerged for read2

5. Merge "merged" .bam files for individuals that were spread accross multiple lanes
  - example code where KLC098_am_merged.bam is the new merged .bam file for the merged reads that were mapped to the am genome
    samtools merge KLC098_am_merged.bam KLC098_USD16091388L_HKFJFDSXX_L4.merged_sorted.bam KLC098_USD16091388L_HKG5MDSXX_L1.merged_sorted.bam
  - example code where RLK019_am_merged.bam is the new merged .bam file for the merged reads that were mapped to the am genome
    samtools merge RLK019_am_merged.bam RLK019_USD16091390L_HJMVKDSXX_L3.merged_sorted.bam RLK019_USD16091390L_HKG5MDSXX_L1.merged_sorted.bam
  - This only needs to be done for KLC098 and RLK019
  
6. Change the name of the "merged" .bam file for individuals that were sequenced on a single lane
  - example code where RLK004_am_merged.bam is the new merged .bam file for the merged reads that were mapped to the am genome
    mv RLK004_USD16091389L_HJNHCDSXX_L3.merged_sorted.bam RLK004_am_merged.bam
  - example code where RLK034_am_merged.bam is the new merged .bam file for the merged reads that were mapped to the am genome
    mv RLK034_USD16091387L_HJNHCDSXX_L2.merged.sam RLK034_am_merged.bam
  - This only needs to be done for RLK004 and RLK034
  
7. Merge "unmerged" .bam files for individuals that were spread accross multiple lanes
  - example code where KLC098_am_merged.bam is the new merged .bam file for the unmerged reads that were mapped to the am genome
    samtools merge KLC098_am_unmerged.bam KLC098_USD16091388L_HKFJFDSXX_L4.unmerged_sorted.bam KLC098_USD16091388L_HKG5MDSXX_L1.unmerged_sorted.bam
  - example code where RLK019_am_unmerged.bam is the new merged .bam file for the unmerged reads that were mapped to the am genome
    samtools merge RLK019_am_unmerged.bam RLK019_USD16091390L_HJMVKDSXX_L3.unmerged_sorted.bam RLK019_USD16091390L_HKG5MDSXX_L1.unmerged_sorted.bam
  - This only needs to be done for KLC098 and RLK019

8. Change the name of the "unmerged" .bam file for individuals that were sequenced on a single lane
  - example code where RLK004_am_unmerged.bam is the new merged .bam file for the unmerged reads that were mapped to the am genome
    mv RLK004_USD16091389L_HJNHCDSXX_L3.unmerged_sorted.bam RLK004_am_unmerged.bam
  - example code where RLK034_am_unmerged.bam is the new merged .bam file for the unmerged reads that were mapped to the am genome
    mv RLK034_USD16091387L_HJNHCDSXX_L2.unmerged.sam RLK034_am_unmerged.bam
  - This only needs to be done for RLK004 and RLK034

9. Get percentage of merged reads that mapped to each reference
  a. Get number of total reads for each individual to each reference genome from mapped_reads/<reference_abbreviation>/<sample_id>_<reference_abbreviation>_merged.bam
    - samtools view -c <sample_id>_<reference_abbreviation>_merged.bam # do this for each *_merged.bam file
  b. Get number of total reads that mapped for each individual to each reference genome from mapped_reads/<reference_abbreviation>/<sample_id>_<reference_abbreviation>_merged.bam
    - samtools view -c -F 260 <sample_id>_<reference_abbreviation>_merged.bam # do this for each *_merged.bam file
  c. Then divide the number of merged reads that mapped (from part b) / the total number of merged reads (from part a)
  
10. Get average depth for the .bam file of the merged reads for each individual

11. Get percentage of unmerged reads that mapped to each reference
  a. Get number of total reads for each individual to each reference genome from mapped_reads/<reference_abbreviation>/<sample_id>_<reference_abbreviation>_unmerged.bam
    - samtools view -c <sample_id>_<reference_abbreviation>_unmerged.bam # do this for each *_unmerged.bam file
  b. Get number of total reads that mapped for each individual to each reference genome from mapped_reads/<reference_abbreviation>/<sample_id>_<reference_abbreviation>_unmerged.bam

13. Merge "unmerged" and "merged" .bam files into a single file for each individual
  - example code where KLC098_am.bam is the new merged .bam file for all reads
  samtools merge KLC098_am.bam KLC098_am_merged.bam KLC098_am_unmerged.bam # do this for each individual
  
14. Get percentage of all reads (merged & unmerged) that mapped to each reference

Later: Look at mapping success between species to the A. marmoratus genome
