1. Double check all of the mapped reads to make sure they mapped to the right genome!
grep ^@PG KLC098_USD16091388L_HKFJFDSXX_L4.merged.sam

2. Map merged reads to reference for Aspidoscelis marmoratus (unnanotated) genome
- Randy will work on getting genome onto lonepeak scratch
- This has already been done for all the others

3. Map unmerged reads to reference genomes
bwa mem -t 4 "$2" ${1}.fq.gz > "$3"/${1}.sam

4. Get number of unmerged reads from fastp for each species
a. Count number of unmerged for read1, then count number of unmerged for read2

5. Get percentage of merged reads that mapped to each reference

6. Get percentage of unmerged reads that mapped to each reference

7. Look at mapping success between species to the A. marmoratus genome
